# Traco

Translatable columns for Rails 3, stored in the model table itself.

Inspired by Iain Hecker's [translatable_columns](https://github.com/iain/translatable_columns/).

To store translations outside the model, see Sven Fuchs' [globalize3](https://github.com/svenfuchs/globalize3).


## Usage

Say you want `Post#title` and `Post#body` to support both English and Swedish values.

Name those database columns with locale suffixes, e.g. `title_sv` and `title_en`. No `title` column.

Declare these columns in the model:

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      translates :title, :body
    end

Now, you can still use the `title_sv` accessors in forms, validations and other code, but you also get:

`#title`:  Shows the title in the current locale. If blank, falls back to default locale, then to any locale.

`#title=`: Assigns the title to the column for the current locale, if present. Raises if the column doesn't exist.

`.human_attribute_name(:title_sv)`: Extends this standard method to return "Title (Swedish)" if you have a translation key `i18n.languages.sv = "Swedish"` and "Title (SV)" otherwise. Rails uses this method to build validation error messages and form labels.

`.translatable_columns`: Returns an array like `[:title, :body]`.

`.locales_for_column(:title)`: Returns an array like `[:sv, :en]` sorted with default locale first and then alphabetically. Suitable for looping in forms:

    <% Post.locales_for_column(:title).each do |locale| %>
      <p>
        <%= form.label "title_#{locale}" %>
        <%= form.text_field "title_#{locale}" %>
      </p>
    <% end %>

And the equivalent methods for `body`, of course.


## Installation

Add this to your `Gemfile` if you use Bundler 1.1+:

    gem 'traco', github: 'barsoom/traco'

Or with an earlier version of Bundler:

    gem 'traco', git: 'git://github.com/barsoom/traco.git'

Then run

    bundle

to install it.


## Running the tests

    bundle
    rake # or guard

<!-- Keeping this a hidden brain dump for now.

## TODO

We've intentionally kept this simple with no features we do not need.
We'd be happy to merge additional features that others contribute.

Possible improvements to make:

  * Validation that checks that at least one translation for a column exists.
  * Validation that checks that every translation for a column exists.
  * Option to disable fallback.
  * Scopes like `translated`, `translated_to(locale)`.
  * Support for region locales, like `en-US` and `en-GB`.
